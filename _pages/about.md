I am currently a Master's student in Biomedical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, China, in 2019. Additionally, I am a member of the Neural Computing and Control Laboratory (NCC Lab) at SUSTech, under the guidance of Professor [Quanying Liu](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=liuqy&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1&lang=en), where I focus on research in non-invasive brain-computer interfaces. My long-term research goal is to leverage artificial intelligence techniques to develop commercially viable general-purpose brain-computer interfaces.
